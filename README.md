# CIFO_Project
This repository contains the project of Group Teletubbies made for the course of CIFO, part of the MDSAA @NOVAIMS .

The project focuses on the use of Genetic Algorithms to optimize and reach a specific target solution (melody of a song);
The main idea is experimenting with different operators such as Crossover, Mutation, Initalization, Selection and comparing their respective performances, looking to select optimal operatos and reach a final algorithms that finds the optimal solution to the problem;
